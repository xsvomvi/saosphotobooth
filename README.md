Sao's Portfolio

Author: Saomai Ngo
Project: Showcase Portfolio Website

# Overview

Sao's Portfolio is a personal showcase website created to present my growth, progress and creative development as a designer and developer. The portfolio includes a home page, projects page, skills page and contact page. Each section highlights a different part of my journey and provides insight into who I am professionally and creatively.

This portfolio is not only a space to display finished work, but also a reflection of my learning process and evolving design approach.

# Project Goal

The goal of this project was to create a personal portfolio that demonstrates my development in both design and web development. I wanted to show my growth over time and present it in a way that feels authentic to my personality and style. The portfolio highlights completed projects while also acknowledging the learning journey behind them. It serves as both a professional showcase and a personal documentation of progress.

# My Role

I was responsible for every stage of creating this portfolio. This included:
-- Planning the concept and overall visual style
-- Designing wireframes and page layouts
-- Creating interactive prototypes
-- Developing the website structure and content
-- Refining the user experience through feedback and iteration

My focus was to build a portfolio that is visually engaging and easy to navigate. The portfolio should also clearly communicate my skills, creativity and personal identity.
