# Anime Photobooth Website

**Author:** Saomai Ngo
**Project:** Sao's Photobooth Website

## Overview

This website is an interactive web experience created especially for anime fans. The website allows users to use an online photobooth to create their own anime-inspired photostrip.

The experience includes choosing a photostrip design with anime visuals, taking three photos using a webcam and saving the final photostrip to the desktop.

This project is not only meant as entertainment, but also as a reflection of my growth and development in front-end development, interactive design and creative concept building.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project was to design and develop a fun and interactive anime photobooth experience. I wanted to create a website that not only works well technically, but also feels visually engaging and aligned with anime culture.

This project also allowed me to show my growth in:

* working with interactive features such as camera input
* combining design and development
* translating a creative concept into a functional web application

The photobooth showcases how I turn ideas into digital experiences that feel personal and playful.

## My Role

I was responsible for every stage of this project, including:

* Planning the concept and overall photobooth experience
* Designing the photostrip layouts and visual style
* Creating the user flow and interactions
* Developing the website and photobooth functionality
* Testing, refining and improving the user experience

My focus was on building a website that is enjoyable to use, easy to navigate and visually expressive. The anime photobooth reflects both my creative identity and my technical development.
